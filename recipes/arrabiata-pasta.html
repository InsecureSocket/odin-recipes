    <h2>Tasty arrabiata on the cheap</h2>
    <p>A fast and spicy supper that’s ready in less than 20 minutes. Feel free to use any pasta shapes you like and
        chopped fresh chilli instead of dried flakes if you prefer. The cheddar can be swapped for Parmesan or any
        cheese you have handy – or left out altogether.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>100g dried pasta</li>
        <li>3tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ – ½ tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
        <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>25g/1oz chedder, finely grated, to serve</li>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Half-fill a medium saucepan with water and cover with a lid. Place over a high heat and bring to the
                    boil. Add the pasta and stir. Cook uncovered for 10–12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender but
                    retains just a little ‘bite’. Stir occasionally as the pasta cooks, so it doesn’t stick.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, heat the oil in a frying pan. Add the garlic and cook over a very low heat for 2 minutes,
                    or until the garlic is softened but not browned, stirring regularly. Add the chilli flakes and cook
                    for a few seconds more, stirring constantly</p>

            <li>
                <p>Remove the pan from the heat and gently stir the tomatoes into the garlic-infused oil. Place the pan
                    over a medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring regularly until the
                    sauce is fairly thick and glossy. Season with a little salt and lots of pepper.</p>
