    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>450g Potatoes</li>
        <li>3 units Garlic Clove</li>
        <li>1 unit Broccoli</li>
        <li>60g Mature Cheddar Cheese</li>
        <li>240g Beef Mince</li>
        <li>1 sachet Dried Rosemary</li>
        <li>30g Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>28g Red Wine Stock Paste</li>
        <li>15g Worcester Sauce</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat your oven to 240°C/220°C fan/gas mark 9.</br>

                    Halve the potatoes lengthways (no need to peel) and pop them onto a baking tray. Drizzle with oil
                    and
                    season with salt and pepper.</br>
                    Rub the oil into the potatoes, then lay them, cut-side down, on the
                    baking
                    tray.</br>

                    Once the oven is hot, roast on the top shelf until tender and a knife slips in easily, 30-40 mins.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, peel and grate the garlic (or use a garlic press).

                    Cut the broccoli into florets (like small trees), halving any large ones.

                    Grate the cheese.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Heat a large frying pan on medium-high heat (no oil).</br>

                    Once hot, add the beef mince and fry until browned, 5-6 mins. Use a spoon to break it up as it
                    cooks,
                    then
                    drain and discard any excess fat.

                    Season with salt and pepper. </br>
                    IMPORTANT: Wash your hands and equipment after handling raw mince.
                    The
                    mince is
                    cooked when no longer pink in the middle.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Add the dried rosemary and two thirds of the garlic to the pan. Cook, stirring, for 1 min.</br>

                    Stir in the tomato puree, red wine stock paste, Worcester sauce, sugar and water for the sauce (see
                    pantry
                    for both amounts).</br>

                    Bring to the boil, then simmer until the Bolognese has thickened, 5-6 mins. Taste and season with
                    salt
                    and
                    pepper if needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of oil in another medium frying pan on medium-high heat. Once hot, add the
                    broccoli and stir-fry for 2-3 mins.</br>

                    Stir in the remaining garlic, then turn the heat down to medium. Cook for 1 min, then add a splash
                    of
                    water.</br>

                    Pop a lid on the pan, or cover in foil, and cook until tender, a further 5-6 mins. Season with salt
                    and
                    pepper.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When everything's ready, share the potatoes between your plates. Spoon the Bolognese over the top,
                    then
                    finish with a sprinkle of Cheddar.</br>

                    Serve the garlic broccoli alongside.

                    Enjoy!</p>
