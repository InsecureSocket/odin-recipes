    <h2>Simple Macaroni & Cheese Dish for riding solo</h2>
    <p>A really creamy and lush macaroni cheese on a budget. It’s worth making a homemade cheese sauce here as it’s
        cheap and can be made in just a few minutes. The sauce is also great as a topping for cooked vegetables or other
        pasta bakes.

    <p>This recipe taken from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/mac_n_cheese_for_one_03858">BBC Food</a> </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>75g dried pasta, preferably penne or macaroni
        <li>
        <li>20g butter</li>
        <li>20g plain flour</li>
        <li>300ml milk</li>
        <li>50g cheddar (preferably mature), finely grated</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
        <li>crusty bread to serve</li>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Half-fill a large saucepan with water and cover with a lid. Place over a high heat and bring to the
                    boil. Add the pasta, stir well and return to the boil. Cook without a lid for 10–12 minutes, or
                    until the pasta is tender but retains a little ‘bite’, stirring occasionally so it doesn’t stick.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Meanwhile, place a medium saucepan (ideally non-stick) over a medium heat, add the butter and allow
                    to melt. As soon as the butter has melted, sprinkle over the flour and stir well with a wooden spoon
                    until it is completely mixed with the melted butter.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Slowly start adding the milk, just a little at a time and stirring well between each addition.
                    (Adding the milk just 3 tablespoons at a time to begin with will help keep the sauce smooth). When
                    you first add the milk, the flour mixture will seize up and look a little lumpy, but the more you
                    stir, the smoother it will become. Continue gradually adding and stirring until all the milk is used
                    up.</p>

            <li>
                <p>Stir in roughly two-thirds of the cheese, a generous pinch of salt and 3–4 twists of black pepper
                    (roughly ¼ tsp coarsely ground pepper). Simmer the sauce gently for 2–3 minutes, stirring constantly
                    until it is thickened and glossy.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                </p>Drain the pasta well in a colander or sieve and return to the pan. Pour the cheese sauce over the
                top
                and stir well. Either serve from the pan with the remaining grated cheese on top or transfer to an
                ovenproof dish and place under a hot grill for 1–2 minutes until lightly browned. Serve with the bread,
                if using.</p>
            </li>
